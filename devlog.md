To solve this Prolog maze project, I'll develop a predicate find_exit/2 that navigates from a start position to any exit in a maze represented as a 2D list of cells. First, I'll validate the maze structure and confirm it contains exactly one start cell, then locate this starting position by scanning the maze. The core solution will implement a depth-first search algorithm that recursively tries moving in each direction (left, right, up, down), tracking visited positions to avoid cycles. For each potential move, I'll verify it stays within maze boundaries and doesn't hit walls, then determine if it reaches an exit or requires further exploration. The implementation will leverage Prolog's natural backtracking capabilities to explore alternative paths when hitting dead ends. I'll create helper predicates to handle position validation, movement mechanics, and exit detection, gradually building up the action list as the search progresses. This approach takes advantage of Prolog's logical reasoning and pattern matching to elegantly solve the pathfinding problem without needing explicit loop constructs or complex data structures.
